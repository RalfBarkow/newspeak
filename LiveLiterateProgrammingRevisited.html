The <a href="" -="newspeaklanguage.org">Newspeak web page</a> argues for  creating  applications as:
<br><br>
<i>interactive narratives via live, literate programming. We want an editor for interactive narratives.</i>
<br><br>
This article describes the current state of live literate programming support in Newspeak.
Let's begin by recapping what live literate programming means.
<br><br>
<i>Live programming</i> means that when you change a program, 
you instantly see the consequent changes to its behavior. 
<br>
To illustrate this, consider the trivial counter application shown below:
<div class="ampleforth" contenteditable ="false" name="counter"></div>
The counter is live; try it out. 
You can use the increment button to increment the counter,
the decrement button to decrement it, and reset to set it back to its initial value. 
Leave the counter at a non-zero value. This will be useful later.
<br><br>
Suppose you decide that the word <i>reset</i> isn't clear. 
You'd like the reset button's label to be more explicit - perhaps it should
say <i>set to 0</i>.
<br><br> 
The code that controls the counter display is shown below:
<div class="ampleforth" contenteditable ="false" name="counterDefinition"></div>
  <br><br>
  Change the line that determines the reset button's label 
  (it's just above the closing curly brace, <b>}</b>) to read:<br>
  <i>button: 'set to 0' action: [updateGUI: [subject clear]]. </i>
  <br>
  and accept the change.  
  <br><br>
  The displayed counter has changed as desired.
  Moreover, the state of the counter is preserved - its value is as you left it before you changed the program;
  we did not restart the counter program, or refresh the web page.
  This is crucial. The counter state may be trivial, but in any real application,
  recreating the program state is difficult, tedious, time consuming and error prone.
  <br><br>
  <i>Literate programming</i> means writing programs as essays: a well structured narrative, 
  designed for human consumption, well presented in every both logically and physically. 
  <br><br>
 <i>Live literate programming</i> combines live and literate programming into something greater than the sum of its parts.  
 You should be able to write programs as essays, if you so desire, but you should also be free to write them as 
 slide presentations or interactive demonstrations or perhaps something else entirely. And you should
 be able to write multiple narratives about the program, or about sevral programs. And they should all be live.
 <br><br>
 This post is a simple example of live literate programming used to discuss itself. 
<h2>Compositionality</h2>
In <a href="https://blog.bracha.org/illiterateProgramming/out/illiterateProgramming.html">Illiterate Programming</a>, 
a post I wrote back in 2016,
I discussed an early version of live literate programming support for Newspeak.  One of its weaknesses was that it didn't
compose properly: one could embed live Newspeak widgets in a document, but not vice versa. That's been fixed, as shown here:
<br><br>
<div class="ampleforth" contenteditable ="false" name="sampleHelp" style="width: 500"></div>
<br><br>
Above is a simple object presenter on the number 42.  Toward its top right you'll see a question mark. Click on it.
You can now see the help text for the object presenter, which is itself defined as a rich text document. 
This document is embedded in a Newspeak widget, the object presenter, which in turn
is embedded in the this document.
<h2>Editing</h2>
How do we create or modify documents like this one? A document is an object, and we can create it in
the IDE and edit it there.  To illustrate, consider the document below.  
It's being viewed via an object presenter.  We see that the document is an instance of
class <b>LiveAnE_mmanual</b>. Each document has its own class, which is always
a subclass of <b>Document</b>. The object presenter includes an evaluator, where we can
evaluate expressions in the scope of the object. Underneath the evaluator,  we see two tabs:
<br><br>
<i>[instance of DocumentSubject`401472712]</i> and <i>[Basic]</i>.
<br><br>
Each tab selects a different view of the document. The <i>Basic</i> tab will show us the 
document as a regular object, 
listing its slots. The other tab, which is selected by default, shows us the document 
properly rendered.
<br><br>
<div class="ampleforth" contenteditable ="false" name="e_mmanuel_object"></div>
<br><br>
On the right, you see the document rendered as rich text. On the left is a text editor showing 
raw HTML code used to define the document. You can edit it; perhaps you think the word 
<b>E_mmanual</b> is  a typo. Maybe it should be written <b>E_manual</b>, or perhaps 
<b>Emmanuel</b>. Notice that as you type in the raw text window, the rendered text changes live.
<br><br>
Ok, you sniff, but there are no live widgets here. Indeed, the better to let you add them, my dears.
<br><br>
Type in the following after the word <i>step</i>:
<br><br>
<i>&lt;div class = "ampleforth"name = "alertButton"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</i>
<br><br>
You should see a button materialize in the rendered version. Do as it says - press it. 
A helpful alert message will appear.
<br><br>
Ok, so how does it work?  The system replaces any DOM element marked with class 
<i>ampleforth</i> with a Newspeak widget. 
Which widget to use is determined by the <i>name</i> attribute of the DOM element in question.
The value of the <i>name</i> attribute should identify a Newspeak method with no arguments.
The identified method is invoked on the document; the result should be
a Newspeak widget (technically, a Hopscotch fragment), which will be displayed at that
point.. 
<br><br>
In the case above, a method named <b>alertButton</b> is already in place.  
If it isn't, we have to add it. To do that, we simply edit the class of the document. We
can access the class by clicking on the toggle to the left of <i>class</i> near the top of the object presenter.
This expands the class in place, so we can add a new method  to it. We can also see the existing
<b>alertButton</b> method we used above.
<h2>What Could Go Wrong?</h2>

What if the expression given in the document does not evaluate to a
  Fragment? 
  <br>
  If it evaluates without error, we place an
  error message that links to an inspector on the result in the 
  document.
  <br>
<div class="ampleforth" contenteditable ="false" name="notAFragment"></div>
<br>
Consider a bad selector in the <i>name</i> attribute of an <i>ampleforth</i> node.
<br>
<div class="ampleforth" contenteditable ="false" name="foo"></div>
<br>
<br>
We get a link to a debugger showing the error.
<br><br>
Another interesting situation is recursion, as attempted below, which yields an informative error message: 
<br>
<br>
<div class="ampleforth" contenteditable ="false" name="AmpleforthTargetDocument"></div>
<h2>How Real Is It?</h2>

Well, it's good enough to write this post.  To the right of the text your reading, you should be able to
locate two arrow symbols. Clicking on the top one will reveal the editor menu;
the other will open the raw HTML window containing the source for this post. 
<br><br>Try changing the source;  improve this post until you like it.

<h2>Issues</h2>

Of course, there's plenty more to be done. One ongoing project is <b>Telescreen</b> which manages 
a sequence of documents. Such a sequence might consist of slides of a presentation, or posts in a blog,
or chapters in a book. Here are a few more (by no means an exhaustive list).
<h3>IDE Dependency</h3>
The current scheme is tightly tied to the IDE. This makes sense for live literate programming, 
but what of other applications, like computational notebooks? There we use code to illustrate other 
phenomena, and have less interest in browsing the code when showing the document.
<br><br>
However we still need to develop such code as we write the document, and readers may wish to 
review it. So some IDE access is necessary, but we should have a way of eliminating it when it is
no longer needed. This is important both to keep document size down, and for security. The IDE
grants a lot of power.  If documents have such powerful access, they are a potentially dangerous form of 
mobile code, though deploying them through the web browser mitigates that.

<h3>State</h3>

What if we want to preserve the document in a specific state - say, with a toggle open or closed.
Since a document is an object, it can be serialized in that state and reconstituted. Convenient support
for that is still missing  in the current prototype.

<h3>HTML Dependency</h3>
What happens if we don't run on the web? For example, our use of documents for help in the IDE 
means that the IDE's help facility wouldn't work if we ran it on another platform.
<br><br>
As another example, what if we want to produce a dead document, say, for publication at
a conference, or (gasp) a printout.
<h3>WYSIWYG</h3>
Obviously, editing HTML isn't ideal. We need a WYSIWYG editor. At the same time, I firmly believe that
the editor's underlying model should be a description of the document in a markup language.
<br><br>
<i>Tangent: Obviously, HTML isn't my ideal markup, but that is one ocean I won't attempt to 
boil today. Not that I don't have very specifc ideas on that, but that is for another time.</i>
<br><br>
That way, one can edit the document in either the markup view or the WYSIWYG view, and the
the two are always automatically kept consistent. 

<h2>Summary</h2>
We're approaching the point where we can really do live literate programming in Newspeak. 
The biggest issues now are the performance and robustness of the Newspeak web-based implementation itself. 
A key idea is that documents are objects and therefore naturally have a dynamic scope which
is used to reference live objects within it.  Documents then mesh naturally with exemplar support in the
IDE, making it easy to write code in the scope of the document and evaluate it live at any point.
A Document contains a markup program that runs in the document's scope. 
Executing the markup subsumes the concept of weaving
a literate program. The structured view of code provided by a Smalltalk-style IDE likewise subsumes
tangling.</div>
