What is Live Programming? 
</h1>

<i>Live programming</i> means that when you change a program, 
you instantly see the consequent changes to its behavior. 
<br>
To illustrate this, consider the trivial counter application shown below:
<div class = "ampleforth" name = "counter" ></div>
The counter is live; try it out. 
You can use the increment button to increment the counter,
the decrement button to decrement it, and reset to set it back to its initial value.
<br><br>
Suppose you decide that the word <i>reset</i> isn't clear. 
You'd like the reset button's label to be more explicit - perhaps it should
say <i>set to 0</i>.
<br><br> 
The code that controls the counter display is shown below:
<div class = "ampleforth" name = "counterDefinition"></div>
  <br><br>
  Change the line that determines the reset button's label 
  (it's just above the closing curly brace, <b>}</b>) to read:<br>
  <i>button: 'set to 0' action: [updateGUI: [subject clear]]. </i>
  <br>
  and accept the change.  
  <br><br>
  The displayed counter has changed as desired.
  Moreover, the state of the counter is preserved: 
  we did not restart the counter program, or refresh the web page.
  <br><br>
  This is crucial. The counter state may be trivial, but in any real application,
  recreating the program state is difficult, tedious, time consuming and error prone.
